## Overview

Flat, 2D interface with bold colors, no shadows/gradients, clean lines, simple geometric shapes, icon-heavy, typography-focused, minimal ornamentation. Ideal for landing pages, saas. AI-ready template. Microsoft fired the first shot. Windows Phone's Metro UI in 2010 stripped everything back to typography and color blocks — no chrome, no bevels, no apologies. Most designers shrugged it off as corporate minimalism. Then Apple nuked skeuomorphism overnight with iOS 7 in 2013, and suddenly every leather texture and drop shadow on the internet looked embarrassing. The industry pivoted in months.

Google complicated things with Material Design in 2014, reintroducing elevation and shadow as meaningful hierarchy tools. Purists called it a betrayal. Pragmatists called it usable. Either way, it proved that pure flat had accessibility problems — when everything sits on the same plane, users lose depth cues.

By 2026, flat won the war but absorbed the lessons. Neumorphism came and went like a fever dream. Glassmorphism had its moment on Dribbble and mostly stayed there. What survived is flat's core conviction — that interfaces should communicate through color, type, and space, not simulate physical materials. The shadows that remain are functional, not decorative. That's the settlement.

## Typography

- **Display / Hero:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — Weight 700, tight tracking, used for headline impact

- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono — Used for code, metadata, and technical values

Scale:
- Hero: clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4rem)
- H1: 2.25rem
- H2: 1.5rem
- Body: 1rem / 1.6
- Small: 0.875rem


## Layout

- **Grid:** CSS Grid primary. Max-width containment: 1280px centered with 1.5rem side padding.
- **Spacing rhythm:** Balanced. Base unit: 0.5rem (8px).
- **Section vertical gaps:** clamp(4rem, 8vw, 8rem).
- **Hero layout:** Split-screen (text left, visual right).
- **Feature sections:** Zig-zag alternating text+image rows. No 3-equal-columns.
- **Mobile collapse:** All multi-column layouts collapse below 768px. No horizontal overflow.
- **z-index contract:** base (0) / sticky-nav (100) / overlay (200) / modal (300) / toast (500).


## Elevation & Depth

No gradients/shadows, simple hover (color/opacity shift), fast loading, clean transitions (150-200ms ease), minimal icons

- **Physics:** Ease-out curves, 200-300ms duration. Smooth and predictable.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 420ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 80ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Subtle color shift + shadow adjustment over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade only (200ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 2px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Primary Button:** Sharp edges (0px) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Sharp edges (0px) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.
- **Inputs:** Label above input. 1px border stroke. Focus ring: 2px accent color offset 2px. Error text below in semantic red. No floating labels.
- **Navigation:** Primary surface background. Active item: accent color indicator. Font weight 500 when active.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No decorative gradients — flat color only
- No shadows heavier than 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do No shadows/gradients
- Do 4-6 solid colors max
- Do Clean lines consistent
- Do Simple shapes used
- Do Icon-heavy layout
- Do High saturation colors

## AI Visual Direction

Create a flat, 2D interface with bold colors, no shadows/gradients, clean lines, simple geometric shapes, icon-heavy, typography-focused, minimal ornamentation. Use 4-6 solid, bright colors in a limited palette with high saturation.

```

## Design System Variables

```css

```

## Implementation Checklist

- ☐ No shadows/gradients
- ☐ 4-6 solid colors max
- ☐ Clean lines consistent
- ☐ Simple shapes used
- ☐ Icon-heavy layout
- ☐ High saturation colors
- ☐ Fast loading verified

## Execution Rules

1. Strictly follow the defined visual style.
2. Use high-quality inline SVG icons (Heroicons or Lucide style) — NEVER use emojis as icons.
3. Add `cursor-pointer` and smooth `hover` states (transition-all) on all interactive elements.
4. Required Page Structure:
   - Navbar (Logo + Links + CTA)
   - Hero Section (Impactful Headline + Subtitle + 2 buttons + 3D/Abstract visual element via CSS)
   - Features (3 cards with icons)
   - Testimonials (3 cards)
   - Pricing (3 tiers, highlight the middle one)
   - Final CTA
   - Full Footer with social links, privacy policy, terms of use, contact and SEO links.
5. All text content must be in English.
6. The visual must be CLEARLY distinct — do not create a "default Bootstrap" design. Force the use of the provided design system variables.
7. Use `<style>` tags in the head for custom classes (especially for complex backdrop-filter effects and animations) that Tailwind CDN doesn't cover.
8. Full Responsiveness: Layout must adapt perfectly to Mobile, Tablet and Desktop (vertical stack on mobile).
9. Include basic SEO, Viewport and Open Graph meta tags in `<head>`.
10. Footer must contain: Copyright 2026, Secondary navigation links and Social media icons.
11. Make the creative decisions needed to deliver the complete, functional result now.
